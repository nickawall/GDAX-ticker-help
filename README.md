# GDAX-ticker-help
I haven't coded in a few years and am having real trouble....
I know VBA and VB6 reasonably well but couldn't get the websocket feed using Winsock (VB6)
I have downloaded the GDAX trading toolkit, Node, git and typescript but am absolutely lost on what I need to do with any of it.

Any help would be greatly appreciated

Thanks, Nick
